# TMTDyn_Multi_Arm_Simu
This simulation package is explored based on the original TMTDyn provided by Dr. S.M.Hadi Sadati (please check the link https://github.com/smhadisadati/TMTDyn for more details). This modified version is applicable for multiple arms' simulation in which there is no interaction force among each of them.
