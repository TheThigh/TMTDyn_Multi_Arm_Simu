# TMTDyn_Multi_Arm_Simu
This simulation package is explored based on the original TMTDyn provided by Dr. S.M.Hadi Sadati (please check the link https://github.com/smhadisadati/TMTDyn for more details). This modified version is applicable for multiple arms' simulation in which there is no interaction force among each of them, currently it is still in beta stage, more fancy functions like simulating impact and contact dynamics will be covered in the near future.
