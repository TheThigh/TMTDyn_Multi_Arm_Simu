The TMTDyn package could run successfully with our SRA backpack hardware geometry settings with max 
pressure input 29 bar (absolute pressure), and the package emerged error when the input pressure was set
 to be 29.5 bar which means that the upper border of the input pressure is in the range of 29~29.5 bar, and
 we don't need to narrow it down further more since this value has far exceeded our test input.

The same thing happened for chamber 2 & 3, 29 bar pressure input was fine, but for 29.5 bar, there will be some 
errors due to the small step size of the ODE solver.
